Story Overview
You are a child living with your family in a slum in India. Your family is very poor and having turned 10 years old just 3 days ago you have taken a job at a local sweatshop. The sweatshop employs many people from your neighbourhood. You must work at the factory but you can also get additional jobs once you finish your shift. Will you be able to support your family and escape the slums?

Gameplay Overview
The game starts with the player having 10 health points and 10 money. The player goes through a day starting with choosing what time to wake up to go to work. The game progresses as the player is posed with situations and must select what they wish to do from a list of options. They play through the day and at the end of the day the user must go back home and give money to their family.  If the player does not have enough money to support their family or if they choose to not give money to their family the game is over and the player has lost. After this last decision the round ends and the next round begins, starting with the player choosing what time to wake up in morning.

Events
There are two kinds of events, user events and random events.

User events are the main type of events that make up the game. Whenever the user has to make a decision, the outcome is a user event. Further, each decision that the player makes has an effect on their health and money of the player. These include,
# Walking or running to work: walking will not change health of money. Running will cause a 1 point decrease in health.
# Getting to work late vs on time: the player can get to work late if they wake up at 7 am and walk to work. If the player is late they loose 1 health point. If the player arrives on time their health and money are not affected.
# Buying drinks or food: the player may occasionally pass by a shop that sells water or food. Buying water decreases money by 1 and increases health by 1. Buying food decreases money by a variable amount and increases health by a variable amount.
# Working and taking breaks (at the sweatshop): by starting work, the user can get 1 money. For each additional challenge that they successfully complete they get 1 money. If they do not successfully complete the task their health decrease by 1. If the user takes a break, their health increases by 1.
Looking for an extra job: this option allows the user to try to find a job in addition to their work at the sweatshop.
# Drug (work): By taking the drug job option the players health decreases by 1. If they successfully sell the drugs their health decreases by 2 and their money increases by 3. On the other hand if the player just takes the drugs their health decrease by 2 and money decreases by 1.
# Sex slavery (work): By taking the slavery option the players money increases by 2 while their health decreases by 2.
# Giving your family money: this is the last decision of the round. The user must give their family money or else they will loose the game. If they choose to give their family money, their money decreases by 4. 

Random events are random unfortunate things that happen to the player. These include,
# a 1 in 100 chance of getting mugged on the way home. This decreases your health and money by 7.
# when you are selling drugs, there is a 1 in 25 chance that you will get mugged. This decreases your health by 4 and your money by 5.

Special commands
The player can gain more insight into the game by using special commands. 
# If the user enters the keyword “status” they can see the players health and money. 
# If the player enters the keyword “q” they can quit the game.

Working
The player “works” at a sweatshop. Working is simulated by doing typing exercises, for example, they are prompted with a word. The user must type in that word and then press the return key a specified number of times. During this time, the player can only work and not use any of the special commands.

Winning
The player can win the game if they can get a balance of 20 money.
